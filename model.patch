All 5 core endpoints working: GET /api/ (root), POST /api/arqueo (create), GET /api/arqueo (list), GET /api/arqueo/{id} (get specific), POST /api/arqueo/{id}/pdf (PDF generation). Calculations verified accurate for c√≥rdobas, dollars, exchange rate (36.5), expenses, and final totals. PDF generation working with valid base64 output. MongoDB integration functional. Minor: Error handling returns 500 instead of 404 for non-existent records, but core functionality unaffected."
